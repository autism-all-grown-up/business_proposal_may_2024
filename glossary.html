<td>When a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 <a href="https://www.oregon%20.%20gov/odhs/aging-disability-services/pages/adl.aspx"><u>https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-servi ces/p ages/adl.aspx</u></a></td>

Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. <a href="https://my.clevelan%20d%20clinic.org/health/diseases/6436-asperger-syndrome"><u>h t tps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436- asper ger-syndrome</u></a></td>

<td><strong>Double Empathy</strong></td>
<td><p>Double empathy refers to how:</p>
<p>1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you</p>
<p>2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you</p>
<p>This concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. <a href="https://embrace%20-%20autism.com/autism-and-the-double-empathy-problem/"><u>https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-do uble- empathy-problem/</u></a></p></td>

<td><strong>Dyslexia</strong></td>
<td>Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. <a href="https://www.bdadyslex%20i%20a.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia"><u>https : //www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/w hat-i s-dyslexia</u></a></td>

<td><strong>Dyspraxia</strong></td>
<td>Dyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). <a href="https://www.%20u%20nderstood.org/en/articles/understanding-dyspraxia"><u>https://www.understood.org/en/articles /unde rstanding-dyspraxia</u></a></td>

<td><strong>fMRI</strong></td>
<td>Functional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity.

However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. https: / /www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism</td>

<td>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. <a href="https://ww" class="uri">https://ww</a> w .psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compul s ive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder</td>

<td><strong>Services Cliff</strong></td>
<td>Many high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. <a href="https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/ov%20e%20rview/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/">[https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overvi e w/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/]{.un derli ne}</a></td>

<td><ul>
<li>*S ynesthesia**</li>
</ul></td>
<td>Synesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. <a href="https://my.cl" class="uri">https://my.cl</a> e velandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Theory of Mind</strong></td>
<td>In psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind</a></td>
