    "text": "4.1 Background\nDr. Ariel Balter, an experienced scientist and data analyst, was diagnosed with ADHD and ASD very late in life and is also raising a teenager with both of these diagnoses. Dr. Balter’s desire to use this new framework to help understand his life and career challenges led him to study the scientific literature on autism as well as non-scientific essays about neurodiversity. He found that both our scientific and social understanding of autism and other types of neurodivergence were going through rapid, seismic changes. Much of the change in the past decade came from autistic self-advocates, and especially autistic researchers putting themselves into the research process. These changes have led to controversies and arguments that are still unfolding and will take time to resolve. However, it is indisputable that a number of facts about autism in adulthood have caught society off guard:\nBecause autism presents as a constellation of traits rather than a linear spectrum of abilities, most autistic adults are able to perform the activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, but often at a great cost to their emotional well-being. The unique challenges we face do not check the boxes in Oregon’s Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) assessments. But they are real.\nIn the Winter of 2023, Dr. Balter started attending local support groups for autistic adults and participating in online communities. He was struck by the level of unmet need he was hearing about from his many peers—people who have skills, education, and abilities but nonetheless are struggling due to common challenges navigating a neurotypical world. Some of these challenges arise from societal factors that will only change over decades through persistent advocacy work. Others simply reflected breakdowns of existing systems (healthcare, employment, social service) largely due to misinformation or lack of information. He began doing some root cause analysis and founded Autism All Grown Up along with some of the amazing people he met.",

Calling ourselves a Nexus refers to how we envision our organization integrating into the universe comprised of autistic adults in Oregon and the various organizations, programs, services, and providers they interact with. Most social organizations are hubs, which means they are locations that take in money along some channels and provide services or information outward along other channels. AAGU will activate and empower the autistic community and autism-focused organizations by improving and building channels of communication and bodies of information they need.\nThis project will combine a long-term strategy with immediate action. There are many things we can do and are doing immediately, such as building relationships, creating information products, and launching The Uncommons (reference). Other goals will take time.\nOur work is already helping autistic adults find and use the services they need and helping others better understand the needs of autistic adults. We are ready to start autistic-friendly meeting and coworking spaces called The Uncommons, where people can safely unmask, mingle, and collaborate authentically. We are working with local organizations to create better information for and about autistic medical needs. We are seeking out programs and organizations that exist but are not widely known about and working to connect these organizations to potential clients and to each other.

    "text": "5.1 It’s a Whole New World\nAlthough Temple Grandin wrote about her experiences as an autistic person in 1983, autistic self-advocacy and voices really gained momentum in the early 2010s. Autistic adults began describing their own experiences as quite different from the prevailing understanding, which had been primarily based on non-autistic observation of children. A small but active cohort of autistic researchers were entering graduate school and soon set up their own research programs. The double empathy hypothesis (Milton, 2012) was repeatedly validated, and the theory of mind deficit hypothesis (Baron-Cohen, 1985) was repeatedly invalidated. Genetic studies and functional MRI (fMRI) imaging showed that autism is purely developmental, highly heritable, and primarily genetic. The prevailing scientific narratives about autism were just wrong.\nThis is not a problem for science. This is the process of science functioning as it should. However, for autistic people in the general population, this is a HUGE problem. Because the scientific community and policymakers had mistakenly assumed that we could treat or even prevent autism, we focused almost all of our resources on children with the assumption that if we succeeded in those efforts, we could greatly reduce the impacts on adults. However, the opposite happened. We now know that people are born autistic and will die autistic. And that while autism frequently co-occurs with challenging conditions such as seizures, speech problems, sensory issues, and physical conditions, whether autism inherently imparts limitations or enhanced abilities varies greatly from person to person, from family to family, and from situation to situation.\nThe use of the term spectrum syndrome in the DSM-V has created some confusion, as often happens when those without clinical and scientific training use clinical and scientific terms without fully educating themselves about them first. Most of us are most familiar with the term “spectrum” in reference to the visual spectrum of light, which is a range of light frequencies that our eyes are sensitive to. A spectrum syndrome actually refers to the concept that the syndrome includes a broad collection of traits as well as a range of presentations among them.\nFigure 1: What “spectrum” really means\nThis revolution in autism science coincided with the growth of the neurodiversity paradigm and resulted in a number of controversies within the autism community. Autism has a high rate of co-occurrence with other areas of neurodiversity. While the term “neurodivergent” does not have a proper scholarly definition, there is a general agreement that it refers to innate aspects of cognition and perception that are based on neurology rather than lived experience. In fact, science has found strong relationships with commonly co-occurring traits, including ADHD, OCD, alexithymia, dyslexia, synesthesia, epilepsy, certain types of cognitive or learning disabilities, and possibly some types of clinical anxiety.\nThe unique experience of every autistic person involves a different set of experiences, differences in perception and perspective, challenges, and areas of strength. This widely acknowledged variation in how autism appears in our lives is partly explained by co-occurring neurodivergences. Creating community and addressing the needs of autistic adults in a useful way necessitates that we are inclusive with respect to all areas of neurodivergence. The neurodiversity paradigm shift forces us to reconsider previous views of autism, both in academia and in the culture at large.\nWe have recently learned that many of these co-occurring neurodivergent traits can be diagnosed independently from autism. We have learned that many non-speaking autistic people are actually capable of using language and can be brilliant writers with assistive technology. We have scientifically confirmed some anecdotes about autistic people in terms of their increased aptitude for problem-solving, pattern matching, cognitive empathy, and certain types of rational and logical thinking. Perhaps most significantly, we have learned through confirmation of the double empathy hypothesis that autistic people are not deficient in either the ability or the desire to socialize. Instead, autistic and non-autistic people have very different socialization styles, learning and sensory needs, limitations, and expectations. All of this is to say that:",

While they rarely qualify for existing systems of support, most face significant challenges that are often overlooked, dismissed, or disbelieved. Most autistic people will tell you that the hardest part about being autistic isn’t being autistic but navigating a neurotypical world that includes unconscious bias and ableism (provide link). As Ludmila N. Praslova writes, Autism Doesn’t Hold People Back at Work. Discrimination Does, and research is backing this up. These things exacerbate the problems individuals may already face due to sensory differences, ADHD, anxiety, and other common issues autistic people deal with. Autistic adults experience substantially elevated suicide risk and reduced life expectancy, and even those with college educations routinely lack full employment. Not only are huge numbers of invisible autistic adults suffering, but society is also missing out on the benefits of their talents and skills.",

Outdated notions of what constitutes genuine autism are overlooked by many people. Because so little research has even acknowledged the lives of adults with autism, we know close to nothing about what successful adult development looks like. Some have described those who were never identified as a lost generation. Late-identified and never-identified autistic adults face unique challenges with respect to aging. Existing research suggests that we face reduced life expectancy, increased risk for physical disability, and an earlier onset of age-related cognitive concerns, including Alzheimer’s and related dementias. There is an immense amount of work to do to help prepare the aging autistic adult community and a poorly informed medical system to successfully face these challenges right now and in the coming decades. Fortunately, there are also many skilled, intelligent, creative, compassionate, and hard-working people in the autistic community who are ready and capable of doing this work.

(find reference for the change in nomenclature) While we know they are out there, no formal surveys have been done to get to know (let alone quantify) the adult autistic population. Consequently, we know very little about who they are, what they want, and what they need. This dearth of knowledge has created huge gaps in available services for these individuals, which adversely impacts them, their families, and their communities in terms of physical health, mental health, and economic well-being. But, ironically, because autism is so misunderstood when they do go looking for help, the majority of autistic adults are perceived as too capable to be needing assistance and simply fall through the cracks.\nDespite the fact that advocates and researchers have been pushing for decades to have autism research funding focus more on quality of life and less on “prevention and cure”, the trend has only gotten worse.\n\nFigure 2.

The sudden drop-off of support upon graduating high school has become known as the services cliff. One of the biggest worries faced by both parents of autistic people and young autistic people themselves is what will happen after they graduate from high school. Will they be offered meaningful work in tolerant and respectful environments? Will they be able to earn enough to live independently? Will they find open doors in trade schools or colleges and be offered the support they might need?\nFortunately, the transition to adulthood has received some attention from the research community and policymakers. Most institutes of higher learning have programs to support neurodivergent students, and many workplaces have enabled employees to form Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to provide peer support. However, accessing those supports requires first getting into college or being hired at an organization that has an autism ERG. In other words, there is some help in some circumstances, but one first has to get there.",

    "section": "6.5 Additional Issues",
    "text": "6.5 Additional Issues\n\n6.5.1 Employment\nAutistic adults without intellectual disabilities face significant challenges in finding and maintaining employment. In a study of 254 autistic adults, 77% reported difficulties in applying for jobs, with challenges in communication, social interaction, and sensory sensitivities. Sensory processing differences are reported by 50-70% of autistic people. Executive functioning challenges, affecting skills like organization and time management, are experienced by an estimated 80% of autistic individuals. However, only 58% of autistic employees report receiving any workplace accommodation.\nUnderemployment is a major issue, with studies finding that 53% of autistic adults work in jobs below their skill level, 51% work part-time despite wanting full-time employment, and only 16% are in full-time paid work. In a survey of 1,201 autistic adults, 51% reported experiencing discrimination in hiring or promotion, and only 14% reported being in full-time employment. The unemployment rate for autistic adults is estimated to be 30-40%, significantly higher than the general population.\nThese challenges lead to financial instability, with 46% of autistic adults reporting incomes below the poverty level. Workplace accommodations, flexibility, and understanding are crucial to improve employment outcomes, but only 28% of autistic employees report having adequate supports at work. Systemic changes are needed to create more inclusive and accessible workplaces for the estimated 50-75% of autistic adults without intellectual disability.\n\n\n6.5.2 Marginalized Populations\nAll of these problems compound for members of intersectional populations who may already be marginalized along other dimensions. Many researchers believe that autism is underdiagnosed in communities of color, particularly in Black communities, as well as for female-presenting people. Meanwhile, fluidity in gender identity and sexual orientation is more highly represented among autistic people. Little research has been done to assess how autism uniquely affects people in these different subgroups.\n\n\n6.5.3 Suicide\nEstimates of the life expectancy of autistic adults are typically about seven to fifteen years lower than expected (O’Nions et al., 2023), a disparity due in part to the higher than average risk for suicide (Hirvikoski et al.2016) and accidental deaths (Smith DaWalt et al., 2019). In contrast to allistic people, these are primary sources of mortality, competing with more typical causes of death in the larger population. An autistic person is nearly as likely to die from suicide as they are to die from cardiovascular disease. And yet, public health efforts and autistic support services largely ignore this reality.\nAutistic people face high rates of suicidality and overrepresentation in deaths by suicide. Current estimates indicate that autistic individuals account for approximately 3-4% of children and 2-3% of adults. However, researchers conducting psychological autopsies indicate that 10% of deaths by suicide are undiagnosed autistic individuals. The same researchers indicate that up to 40% of people who die by suicide have autistic traits. Among diagnosed autistics, as many as 72% of autistic people experience suicidal ideation, and up to 47% of autistic people attempt to end their own lives. The importance of supporting autistic individuals struggling with suicidality is well-established. However, there is a lack of dedicated crisis support for autistic people. The existing resources are clearly not meeting the needs of autistic people, and we need not accept these deaths as inevitable.\nSuicidality in autistic people is not inherent to being autistic. Existing research indicates that autistic suicidality is driven by thwarted belonging and camouflaging autistic traits. Importantly, autistic people communicate suicidality differently than non-autistic people, and the differences between autistic and non-autistic communication leads to misunderstandings. Compounding this, autistic warning signs of suicide differ from neurotypical warning signs. These factors, when combined with the double empathy problem (for example, autistic people express suicidality in a unique way) can lead to both traumatic miscommunications and missed opportunities with tragic outcomes.\n\n\n6.5.4 Physical and Mental Health\nAcross a variety of health domains, autistic people fare worse (Lodi-Smith 2021). Additionally, we are exposed to risks that are not of primary concern for most people (Muskens et al., 2017) These include autoimmune dysregulation of many kinds, autonomic dysregulation, connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and many other areas of health concerns. A lack of understanding regarding these differences, coupled with communication barriers and false notions about autism all collude to create barriers to accessing health services and care.\n\n\n6.5.5 Homelessness\nBarriers to entry to the workplace as well as challenges and holding jobs due to ablest attitudes or inflexible policies put us at risk of severe financial strain (Ohl et al., 2017). This coupled with the possibility of reduced social support all increase our risk of exposure to homelessness. The few studies that attempted to investigate autism in homeless populations suggest that rates of autism in homeless populations is much higher than that observed in the general public, and may be ten times higher (Churchard et al., 2019). Autistic people additionally face extra barriers in accessing the few services for unhoused people. Environments created with the intention of providing support may be aversive or even harmful for autistic people (Kargas et al., 2019).",

    "text": "8.1 Formation\nDr. Ariel Balter, a late diagnosed autistic scientist, conceived of the autism nexus idea when he started performing root cause analysis (RCA) to help members of his new community of local autistic adults. He heard about obstacles to getting evaluations in Oregon and a mixture of opinions regarding why. Determined to provide definitive answers, he found himself working with HealthShare Oregon to create new materials on behalf of OHP specifically designed to give members of the adult community a definitive and complete flowchart of options and contacts. Meetings with administrators from Vocational Rehab allowed him to create a similar prescriptive path that would meet their legal requirements for providing evaluations.\nOn hearing informal discussions of starting occasional co-working meetups at libraries, Dr. Balter found that the community would strongly favor dedicated, autism-friendly coworking spaces. So he explored the minimum requirements to make that happen and found some available options.\nIn order to find if solutions for some of these problems already exist in the community, Dr. Balter searched for and contacted many local organizations that work with autistic adults – Oregon I/DD, The Autism Society of Oregon (ASO), Autism Community Activity Program (ACAP), Autism Research and Resources of Oregon (ARRO), The Arc of Oregon, We’ve Network, Smart Living, Learning, & Earning with Autism (SSLEA) – and was surprised by how little communication, coordination, and mutual awareness existed between them. Dr. Balter began floating ideas for how to foster these connections.\nMost of the organizations that serve the autistic community, both adults and children, create pages on their websites where they list local resources, suggest other organizations, link to useful sources of information, try to answer basic questions and that sort of thing. Providing this information is never the main focus of the organization. Keeping information about autism up-to-date is a job in and of itself. Also, most of these websites are written for or about autistic people rather than by them. The information on these pages degrades much faster than it can be practically updated without a dedicated mission to do so.\nSome of Dr. Balter’s favorite things to do are performing information work, getting to the bottom of difficult problems, and making fortuitous connections between people. Forming an organization that could become the go-to source of information both for and about the adult autistic community seemed like a logical step, and the autism nexus concept was born. By working from within the autistic community, we will build connections between autistic adults, between organizations, and between individuals and organizations. Contrary to outdated misconceptions, autistic people enjoy social connections with and communicate well with people who share their neurology. The talent pool of immensely skilled and capable but underemployed or unemployed autistic adults in Oregon will form the engine that drives our work.\nTeam",

They are the first things that will be finished when we have enough funding to support a small staff for a couple of months.\n\n8.2.1 The Uncommons\nTwo organizations have offered us temporary use of high-quality common space for coworking and meetings. The spaces include internet, printers, computers, meeting areas, lounge areas, and kitchen facilities. This will be the start of The Uncommons.\n\n\n8.2.2 Access to Assessments\nFinding a provider to do an autism or ADHD evaluation can be hard, even with private insurance. For those on Medicaid, it can be literally impossible. We have been partnering with Health Share Oregon to create two guides. One, for Medicaid members, explains the Community Care Organization (CCO) system and outlines the processes and requirements of different health plans. Another, for Medicaid doctors, explains why it is important for adults to get evaluations and provides information on writing a successful referral.\n\n\n8.2.3 Alternate Routes for Assessments\nBecause some networks are entirely lacking providers at this time, we have communicated with I/DD and Vocational Rehab (VR) and created materials to facilitate accessing evaluations through those programs. We have created a template Letter of Medical Necessity based on the requirements these programs use to determine if they will directly pay for a client’s evaluation and the laws about Medicaid/Medicare coverage. This template reduces the burden on providers less familiar with autism in adults, making it easier for them to provide the necessary documentation. A client can have a licensed medical or behavioral practitioner fill out this letter and then present it to I/DD or VR.\n\n\n8.2.4 Outreach Consulting and Development\nWe have begun working with the Autism Society of Oregon to help them refine and improve their online resources, which could turn into a consulting contract.\n\n\n8.2.5 Data Analysis\nAfter discussing the general issues we have described above with the director of the Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder (OCASD), Dr. Balter has been invited to represent AAGU in their data working group.\n\n\n8.2.6 Adult Autism Services Conference\nTo jump-start collaboration and communication between organizations that work with autistic adults, the AAGU has proposed hosting a state-wide conference at which organizations that work with autistic adults can introduce themselves and learn about each other.

We need to research best practices.\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Information\n\nMaintain a database of organizations that provide services for or work with autistic adults, including what services they provide, to whom, how to access these services, and pertinent contact information.\nMaintain a database of medical providers for autistic adults with rich information on their training, experience, specialties, and insurance coverage.\nMaintain a database of miscellaneous community-based entities and programs for autistic adults, such as meetups, businesses, clubs, etc.\nHost these databases on our website through a portal that employs the ultimate in user-friendly and intuitive interfaces. Also, provide an application programming interface (API) for information workers.\nCreate web pages, pamphlets, documents, guides, etc., written in multiple languages and at multiple levels of detail for a neurodiverse audience with information on local issues affecting autistic adults. Examples:\n\nHow to decide if you want/need a diagnosis\nHow to get a diagnosis\nWhat do public entities like OHP, I/DD, and Vocational Rehab do? What should you expect? How to work with them?\nTips for working with medical and mental health providers. For example, advice on how to approach them as an autistic individual.\nInformation to give medical and mental health providers. Most are unaware of differences in our sensory systems, frequency of co-occurring physical conditions, and how to navigate different communication styles.\nForms and checklists\nI just got diagnosed. What do I do now (Oregon-specific)?\n\nCollect any data we can get our hands on connected to autism in Oregon and look for ways to extract useful information from them.\nPerform data analysis and reporting for other organizations or entities on a contract basis.\nParticipate in research studies as subject matter experts and analysts.\nMaintain and update the autism-facts.org website with the most current factual information about autism based on current research and thought.\nRegularly circle back to everything in our database to ensure our information is accurate and current, and timestamp every update. That way, users will know whether the information is up-to-date.\n\nAs you can see, we do not intend to be an advocacy organization or a service organization. Instead we are going to support advocacy, self-advocacy, services, and policy related to autistic adults by providing the community the insights and information assets these other efforts need.",

We hope to raise seed money of $2k-$3k per week to jump start formal operations ************* next $34k for our 8-week Sprout phase. We hope to launch the Sprout phase within our first month.\nA key element of our first 8 weeks of formal operation (Sprout) will be to create a calendar of funding deadlines and communicate with funders to prioritize our initial grant-writing efforts. It will also be crucial that we complete the initial projects we have started during the Sprout phase so we can demonstrate our effectiveness to potential supporters. At the end of the Sprout phase we will report to our umbrella organizations and all funders/sponsors.\nWe have already identified almost 100 grants and sponsorships for which we meet the basic requirements. These include grants from the State of Oregon (e.g. Oregon Health Authority), Oregon healthcare companies (Legacy, Pacific Source, Cambia, etc.), and a mixture of private and public foundations and trusts. We have missed the 2024 funding cycle for some of these, but many have multiple cycles per year or do not run in cycles. Some of these are small pots of money and others regularly award hundred of thousands of dollars. We will also collect sliding-scale fees for using The Uncommons co-working spaces.\nDuring our Grow phase, we hope to show that we can collect, analyse, and disseminate information for and about the adult autistic community with a very high level of capacity and efficiency. We hope this expertise will enable us to secure outside contracts as subject matter experts, analysts, and report writers, which will provide yet another avenue for revenue. We will complete the Grow phase with a report to our umbrella organization and our financial supporters.",

    "text": "Term\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nADLs\nWhen a person applies for Medicaid long-term care services in Oregon, we look at how much help they need to perform Activities of Daily Living. Because funding is limited, we use this information (called a service priority level) to decide who is eligible for services. Activities of Daily Living are the basic personal activities all of us need to do that are essential for health and safety. These activities are defined in OAR 411-015-0006 https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/aging-disability-servi ces/p ages/adl.aspx\n\n\n\n*A lexithymia**\n\nAlexithymia is the inability for someone to recognize, identify, and describe feelings or emotions. It is sometimes referred to as emotional blindness. [https://www.health.com/alexithymia-8361963]{.unde r line}\n\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome\nAsperger’s syndrome (sometimes called high-functioning autism) is part of a wide diagnosis called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since 2013, Asperger’s syndrome is replaced by the broader diagnosis of ASD within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) revised criteria. h t tps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6436- asper ger-syndrome\n\n\nCo-Occurring Conditions\nThe preferred term in the autistic community as a replacement for “comorbid” for conditions, traits, and behaviors that are commonly found along with autism.\n\n\nDouble Empathy\nDouble empathy refers to how:\n1. It is easier to understand the mindset of people who are similar to you\n2. It is more difficult to understand the mindset of those who are different from you\nThis concept was specifically developed by the autistic autism researcher Damian Milton to explain how autistics and neurotypicals empathize with each other. It explains how allistics (non-autistics) struggle to understand the lived experiences of autistics and autistics struggle to understand the lived experiences of allistics. Likewise, autistics are better at understanding other autistics and allistics are better at understanding other allistics. https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-the-do uble- empathy-problem/\n\n\nDyslexia\nDyslexia is a specific learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. However, it does not only affect these skills. Dyslexia is actually about information processing. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. It is important to remember that there are positives to thinking differently. Many dyslexic people show strengths in areas such as reasoning and in visual and creative fields. https : //www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyslexia/about-dyslexia/w hat-i s-dyslexia\n\n\nDyspraxia\nDyspraxia is a term that refers to lifelong trouble with movement and coordination. It’s not a formal diagnosis. But you may still hear people use this term, especially in the U.K. The formal diagnosis is developmental coordination disorder (DCD). https://www.understood.org/en/articles /unde rstanding-dyspraxia\n\n\nfMRI\nFunctional MRI is a type of MRI scan that can show which areas of your brain are most active. Tracking and comparing that activity to what you were doing at the time can help “map” your brain activity. It’s most often used for planning surgery or similar procedures in the brain. https://my.cl e velandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-function al-mr i-fmri\n\n\nGender identity\nOne’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth. [http s ://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-ge n der-identity-terminology-and-definitions]{.underli ne}\n\n\nGenome\nThe genome is the entire set of DNA instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes located in the cell’s nucleus, as well as a small chromosome in the cell’s mitochondria. A genome contains all the information needed for an individual to develop and function. https:// ww w.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome\n\n\nHealth Share Oregon\nOne of Oregon’s Community Care Organizations (CCO) for OHP. https://www.healthshareoregon.org /\n\n\nI/DD\nOregon Department of Human Services: Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\n\nLetter of Medical Necessity\nA Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) is the written explanation from the treating physician describing the medical need for services, equipment, or supplies to assist the claimant in the treatment, care, or relief of their accepted work-related illness(es). https://www.dol . gov/sites/dolgov/files/OWCP/energy/regs/compliance / Outreach/Outreach_Presentation/lmn_mba06222022.pdf\n\n\nNe urodivergent\n\n\n\nNe urodiversity\n\n\n\nNon-Speaking\nWhen an autistic person doesn’t speak, it’s known as nonspeaking autism. You may also see it described as nonverbal autism. However, the term nonverbal isn’t completely accurate, since it means “without words. Even if an autistic person is nonspeaking, they may still use words in other ways (such as in writing). They may also understand the words that are spoken to them or that they overhear. https: / /www.healthline.com/health/autism/nonverbal-autism\n\n\nOCD\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions. https://ww w .psychiatry.org/patients-families/obsessive-compul s ive-disorder/what-is-obsessive-compulsive-disorder\n\n\nODDS\nOregon Office of Developmental Disabilities Services\n\n\nOHP\nOregon Health Plan: Oregon Medicaid\n\n\nServices Cliff\nMany high school students on the autism spectrum get help through special education – most commonly including speech-language therapy, service coordination/case management, behavior management, and special transportation. Each student has a team that works with the student and family to decide which services are needed to prepare him or her for young adulthood, and federal law requires schools to offer the necessary services. Sounds like a good plan for how to help vulnerable youth through a challenging period of life. But then, following the last day of high school, the legal mandate for help suddenly ends. [https://drexel.edu/autismoutcomes/blog/overvi e w/2015/August/falling-off-the-services-cliff/]{.un derli ne}\n\n\nSexual orientation\nAn inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity. [http s ://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-ge n der-identity-terminology-and-definitions]{.underli ne}\n\n\n\n*S ynesthesia**\n\nSynesthesia is when your brain routes sensory information through multiple unrelated senses, causing you to experience more than one sense simultaneously. Some examples include tasting words or linking colors to numbers and letters. It’s not a medical condition, and many people find it useful to help them learn and remember information. https://my.cl e velandclinic.org/health/symptoms/24995-synesthesia\n\n\nTheory of Mind\nIn psychology, theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them. A theory of mind includes the knowledge that others’ beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and thoughts may be different from one’s own. Possessing a functional theory of mind is crucial for success in everyday human social interactions. People utilize a theory of mind when analyzing, judging, and inferring others’ behaviors. The discovery and development of theory of mind primarily came from studies done with animals and infants. Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person’s capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for empathy or sympathy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind\n\n\n\n\nB",

    "text": "D.1 Neurodiversity (concept)\nDefinition: Neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and others, are natural variations of the human genome. This concept emphasizes that these differences should be recognized and respected as a part of human diversity.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodiversity” was coined in the late 1990s by sociologist Judy Singer. It arose from the disability rights movement and the autistic rights movement, which sought to challenge the medical model of disability that views neurological differences as deficits or disorders to be cured. Instead, neurodiversity advocates promote acceptance and understanding, emphasizing the strengths and contributions of neurodivergent individuals.",

It posits that these differences should be seen as normal variations rather than abnormalities or deficits. This paradigm promotes the idea that society should adapt to accommodate these differences rather than forcing individuals to conform to a neurotypical standard.\nHistorical and Social Context: This paradigm shift gained momentum in the early 2000s, aligning with broader social movements advocating for civil rights and inclusion. It has influenced fields like education, employment, and healthcare, encouraging practices that support diverse ways of thinking and learning.",

It seeks to promote understanding, acceptance, and accommodation of neurological differences. The movement has worked to reframe autism as a minority identity rather than a disorder.\nHistorical and Social Context: Emerging in the late 20th century, the neurodiversity movement has been driven by self-advocates and allies. It challenges stigmatizing narratives and calls for systemic changes in how neurodivergent individuals are treated in society. This movement has led to increased visibility and advocacy for policies that support neurodiversity in schools, workplaces, and communities.",

It is an umbrella term that includes various neurological conditions like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and more.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurodivergence” gained prominence alongside the neurodiversity movement. It helps to create a more inclusive language that recognizes the spectrum of neurological differences without implying pathology. This shift in terminology supports a more positive and accepting view of diverse cognitive profiles.",

    "text": "D.6 Neurotypical\nDefinition: Neurotypical refers to individuals whose neurological development and functioning are considered standard or typical by societal norms. It is often used in contrast to neurodivergent.\nHistorical and Social Context: The term “neurotypical” originated within the neurodiversity community as a way to distinguish between those who conform to societal norms of neurological functioning and those who do not. It highlights that “typical” neurological functioning is not the only valid or acceptable way of being, promoting a more inclusive view of human diversity.\n\nD.6.1 References\n\n1. Singer, J.
