## It's a Whole New World

Although Temple Grandin wrote about her experiences as an autistic person in 1983, [[autistic self-advocacy]{.underline}](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8075160/) and voices really gained momentum in the early 2010s. Autistic adults began describing their own experiences as quite different from the prevailing understanding, which had been primarily based on non-autistic observation of children. A small but active cohort of autistic researchers were entering graduate school and soon set up their own research programs. The double empathy hypothesis (Milton, 2012) was repeatedly validated, and the theory of mind deficit hypothesis (Baron-Cohen, 1985) was repeatedly invalidated. Genetic studies and functional MRI (fMRI) imaging showed that autism is purely developmental, highly heritable, and primarily genetic. The prevailing scientific narratives about autism were just wrong.

This is not a problem for science. This is the process of science functioning as it should. However, for autistic people in the general population, this is a HUGE problem. Because the scientific community and policymakers had mistakenly assumed that we could treat or even prevent autism, we focused almost all of our resources on children with the assumption that if we succeeded in those efforts, we could greatly reduce the impacts on adults. However, the opposite happened. We now know that people are born autistic and will die autistic. And that while autism frequently co-occurs with challenging conditions such as seizures, speech problems, sensory issues, and physical conditions, whether autism inherently imparts limitations or enhanced abilities varies greatly from person to person, from family to family, and from situation to situation.

The use of the term *spectrum syndrome* in the DSM-V has created some confusion, as often happens when those without clinical and scientific training use clinical and scientific terms without fully educating themselves about them first. Most of us are most familiar with the term "spectrum" in reference to the visual spectrum of light, which is a *range* of light frequencies that our eyes are sensitive to. A *spectrum syndrome* actually refers to the concept that the syndrome includes a broad collection of traits as well as a range of presentations among them.

This revolution in autism science coincided with the growth of the neurodiversity paradigm and resulted in a number of controversies within the autism community. Autism has a high rate of co-occurrence with other areas of neurodiversity. While the term "neurodivergent" does not have a proper scholarly definition, there is a general agreement that it refers to innate aspects of cognition and perception that are based on neurology rather than lived experience. In fact, science has found strong relationships with commonly co-occurring traits, including ADHD, OCD, alexithymia, dyslexia, synesthesia, epilepsy, certain types of cognitive or learning disabilities, and possibly some types of clinical anxiety.

The unique experience of every autistic person involves a different set of experiences, differences in perception and perspective, challenges, and areas of strength. This widely acknowledged variation in how autism appears in our lives is partly explained by co-occurring neurodivergences. Creating community and addressing the needs of autistic adults in a useful way necessitates that we are inclusive with respect to all areas of neurodivergence. The neurodiversity paradigm shift forces us to reconsider previous views of autism, both in academia and in the culture at large.

We have recently learned that many of these co-occurring neurodivergent traits can be diagnosed independently from autism. We have learned that many non-speaking autistic people are actually capable of using language and can be brilliant writers with assistive technology. We have scientifically confirmed some anecdotes about autistic people in terms of their increased aptitude for problem-solving, pattern matching, cognitive empathy, and certain types of rational and logical thinking. Perhaps most significantly, we have learned through confirmation of the double empathy hypothesis that autistic people are not deficient in either the ability or the desire to socialize. Instead, autistic and non-autistic people have very different socialization styles, learning and sensory needs, limitations, and expectations. All of this is to say that:

-   Autistic children inevitably grow up to be equally autistic adults and later autistic elders.

-   Any individual autistic person has a unique combination of traits that may or may not be disabling in certain contexts.

-   These same traits can be exceptionally enabling, fulfilling, and productive in other contexts.

-   The very fact of being autistic in a predominantly non-autistic world presents obstacles, inflicts subtle traumas, and is extremely exhausting, even for individuals with few intrinsic limitations.
