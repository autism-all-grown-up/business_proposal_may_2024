	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is frequently identified in children but is often unrecognised in adults. {ASD} is characterised by difficulties in social interaction, communication and restricted interests, but other presentations are common, especially in adults. This report describes a 34-year-old man with a history of multiple psychiatric diagnoses including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and panic disorder. He was diagnosed with {ASD} in his early 30s and engaged in a targeted treatment plan, including rationalisation of medications, supportive therapy and occupational therapy, which successfully facilitated discharge from mental health services. This case illustrates the atypical presentation of {ASD} in adults, which is diagnostically challenging. Such cases often present to community mental health services and may be misdiagnosed as treatment resistant cases of depressive, anxiety or personality disorders. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management is more likely to yield a successful outcome.},

A total of 420 adults who identified as autistic, possibly autistic or non-autistic completed an online survey consisting of questions regarding mental health diagnoses they received, whether they agreed with those diagnoses and if not why. Autistic and possibly autistic participants were more likely to report receiving mental health diagnoses compared to non-autistic participants, but were less likely to agree with those diagnoses. Thematic analysis revealed the participants’ main reasons for disagreement were that (1) they felt their autism characteristics were being confused with mental health conditions by healthcare professionals and (2) they perceived their own mental health difficulties to be resultant of {ASC}. Participants attributed these to the clinical barriers they experienced, including healthcare professionals’ lack of autism awareness and lack of communication, which in turn prevented them from receiving appropriate support.

The primary aim of this cross-sectional study design was to identify potential knowledge gaps that were present among medical students and pediatric trainees (interns, residents, and fellows) particularly during the management of a sick child with {ASD}. Methods: A 23-question online survey was developed and distributed to medical students and pediatric trainees at a tertiary children’s hospital affiliated with a medical school. Results: Medical students and pediatric trainees reported a low general knowledge of {ASD} and were unfamiliar with sensory issues that is often present in these children. Increased discomfort and insufficient didactic and clinical training for providing care to children with {ASD} during an acute illness were also identified. Both medical students and trainees reported the need for increased education and training, preferentially via patient interaction and small group-based learning. We found that as education/training levels increased, participants perceived increased comfort and knowledge in managing an ill child with {ASD}. Conclusions: A perceived knowledge gap and discomfort is present amongst medical students and pediatric trainees on the management of children with {ASD}. Across all education levels, awareness for sensory dysregulation in {ASD} children is low. Education programs using direct patient interaction and small group learning were the preferred training modalities to learn how to provide optimal care for children with {ASD}.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Perception of disability is an important construct affecting not only the well-being of individuals with disabilities, but also the moral compass of the society. Negative attitudes toward disability disempower individuals with disabilities and lead to their social exclusion and isolation. By contrast, a healthy society encourages positive attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and promotes social inclusion. The current review explored disability perception in the light of the in-group vs. out-group dichotomy, since individuals with disabilities may be perceived as a special case of out-group. We implemented a developmental approach to study perception of disability from early age into adolescence while exploring cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of children’s attitudes. Potential factors influencing perception of disability were considered at the level of society, family and school environment, and the individual. Better understanding of factors influencing the development of disability perception would allow the design of effective interventions to improve children’s attitudes toward peers with disabilities, reduce intergroup biases, and promote social inclusion. Based on previous research in social and developmental psychology, education, and anthropology, we proposed an integrative model that provides a conceptual framework for understanding the development of disability perception.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

One of the manifestations of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a ‘theory of mind’. We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a ‘theory’. If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using Wimmer and Perner’s puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those with Down’s syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

	abstract = {Background
People on the autism spectrum may have more physical and mental health conditions in midlife and old age compared to the general population. This study describes the physical and mental health of a unique sample of all middle aged and older Wisconsin Medicaid beneficiaries with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and tests differences between those with and without co-occurring intellectual disability.
Method
Using de-identified Medicaid claims data for 143 adults with a recorded autism spectrum disorder diagnosis aged 40–88 years with any Wisconsin Medicaid claims in 2012 through 2015, we extracted diagnoses for physical and mental health conditions from fee-for-service claims. Logistic regression analyses—controlling for sex, race, and age—compared the adjusted odds of physical and mental health conditions for those with and without intellectual disability.
Results
Many physical and mental health conditions, including immune conditions (70.6\%), cardiovascular disease (49.0\%) and its risk factors (46.2\%), sleep disorders (85.3\%), gastrointestinal disorders (49.7\%), neurologic conditions (55.9\%), and psychiatric disorders (72.0\%) were highly prevalent in our full sample. Although there were many similarities between those individuals with and without co-occurring intellectual disability, middle aged and older adults on the autism spectrum had higher prevalence of epilepsy and lower prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to those without co-occurring intellectual disability.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that people on the autism spectrum have a high prevalence of physical and mental health conditions in midlife and old age, regardless of intellectual disability status.},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate autistic people’s views on the importance and availability of adjustments to mental and physical healthcare provision. To explore whether specific categories of adjustments can be identified and to identify any differences in their importance and availability between mental and physical healthcare.
Design Data from two studies, both employing a cross-sectional survey design.
Setting {UK}-based autistic adults registered with the Adult Autism Spectrum Cohort-{UK} were contacted by post or online. In both studies, recruitment was staged over a 12-month period. Non-responders were sent a single reminder letter 2 weeks after initial contact.
Participants 537 autistic adults completed a survey about mental health services (51\% response rate), 407 completed the physical health survey (49\% response rate). Within these samples, 221 participants completed both surveys.
Primary outcome measures Each study developed a bespoke survey to explore participants’ views on mental and physical health services, respectively. Both included an identical list of adjustments that participants rated based on importance and availability.
Results Three factors of important adjustments were identified: sensory environment, clinical and service context, and clinician knowledge and communication. Adjustments across healthcare settings were widely rated as being important yet rarely available. One significant difference between the importance of adjustments available through mental and physical health services was identified. Participants reported that having access to a clinician who is willing to adapt their approach to suit the person’s preferences was significantly more important for participants attending mental health settings (p=0.001).
Conclusions Autistic people reported the limited availability of important adjustments in current healthcare provision. To address unmet need and tackle the health inequalities faced by autistic people attending physical and mental healthcare settings, healthcare providers should offer adjustments relating to the three identified factors. Future research should focus on identifying and addressing service provider barriers to implementation.},

	abstract = {Intellectual disability ({ID}) is characterized by impairments in the cognitive processes and in the tasks of daily life. It encompasses a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders often associated with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). Social and communication abilities are strongly compromised in {ASD}. The prevalence of {ID}/{ASD} is 1–3\%, and approximately 30\% of the patients remain without a molecular diagnosis. Considering the extreme genetic locus heterogeneity, next-generation sequencing approaches have provided powerful tools for candidate gene identification. Molecular diagnosis is crucial to improve outcome, prevent complications, and hopefully start a therapeutic approach. Here, we performed parent–offspring trio whole-exome sequencing ({WES}) in a cohort of 60 mostly syndromic {ID}/{ASD} patients and we detected 8 pathogenic variants in genes already known to be associated with {ID}/{ASD} ({SYNGAP}1, {SMAD}6, {PACS}1, {SHANK}3, {KMT}2A, {KCNQ}2, {ACTB}, and {POGZ}). We found four de novo disruptive variants of four novel candidate {ASD}/{ID} genes: {MBP}, {PCDHA}1, {PCDH}15, {PDPR}. We additionally selected via bioinformatic tools many variants in unknown genes that alone or in combination can contribute to the phenotype. In conclusion, our data confirm the efficacy of {WES} in detecting pathogenic variants of known and novel {ID}/{ASD} genes.},

	shorttitle = {Healthcare access for autistic adults},
	abstract = {Background: 
          People with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) have an increased susceptibility for many chronic health conditions compared with their peers. An increasing number of adolescents are transitioning from pediatric to adult healthcare services. Thus, being able to access appropriate healthcare services that can not only address specific needs of the person but enable them to better manage healthcare conditions and decrease the development of preventable disease is necessary. A systematic review was conducted to identify barriers and enablers of healthcare access for autistic adults.
          Methods: 
          The studies included in the review were quantitative and qualitative and were published between 2003 and 2019. The participants for the review are considered to be adults (over 18 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of {ASD}.
          Results: 
          In total, 1290 studies were initially identified and 13 studies were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in a previous protocol paper. The analysis of these studies identified areas of concern to access appropriate healthcare, such as clinician knowledge, the environment, and life events.
          Conclusion: 
          Identifying the barriers to healthcare, highlights ways healthcare services can regulate scope of practice, the physical environment, and the process of managing health conditions, thus, autistic adults can strive for optimal health. This review contributes to peer-reviewed evidence for future research and up-to-date information when developing and piloting health interventions for autistic adults.

In recent years, however, problematic findings regarding the biological underpinnings of autism; historical research examining the shifting nature of the categorization; and a lack of biomedical utility have led some to suggest abandoning the concept of autism. My interest here is the possibility that autism may remain a meaningful and helpful classification even if it lacks scientific validity and biomedical utility. After arguing that accounts of autism as a psychiatric classification are unsustainable, I draw on feminist philosopher Iris Marion-Young’s distinction between groups and serial collectives in order to account for the reality of autism as a social category, best framed in terms of a social model of disability. When it is taken as a serial collective, I argue, we can coherently understand autistic people as forming a marginalized minority, disabled in relation to the specific material and social contexts, yet in a way that avoids neuro-centric commitments. Autism is thus real and valuable for political and ethical rather than biomedical reasons.},

This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the {BAP} in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, {SD} = 12.61; 58.9\% Female; 1.1\% with an {ASD} diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total {BAP} scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the {BAP} showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs}) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of {ASD} and {BAP} traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in {BAP}. Lay Summary Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.},

In this review, we explored what {GPs} know about autism and the factors that influence their ability to identify and manage care for their patients with autism in practice. We conducted a systematic narrative review using eight electronic databases.

We identified 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies included in the review were conducted between 2003 and 2019. We thematically synthesised the material and identified the following themes: the prototypical image of a child with autism; experience, sources of information, and managing care; barriers to identification; strategies to aid in identification; and characteristics that facilitate expertise. Together, the findings from this review present a mixed picture of {GP} knowledge and experiences in identifying autism and managing care for children with the condition. At one end of the continuum, there were {GPs} who had not heard of autism or endorsed outmoded aetiological theories. Others, however, demonstrated a sound knowledge of the conditions but had limited confidence in their ability to identify the condition. Many {GPs} and researchers alike called for more training and this might be effective. However, framing the problem as one of a lack of training risks silences the array of organisational factors that impact on a {GP}'s ability to provide care for these patients.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communicative difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are due to bi-directional differences in communicative style and a reciprocal lack of understanding. If true, there should be increased similarity in interaction style, resulting in higher rapport during interactions between pairs of the same neurotype. Here, we provide two empirical tests of rapport, with data revealing whether self- and observer- rated rapport varies depending on the match or mismatch in autism status within a pair. An additional opportunity afforded by these data is to examine the effect of the autism status of the rater on the perceived rapport between matched and mismatched pairs. In Study 1 72 participants were allocated to one of three dyad conditions: autistic pairs ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 24), non-autistic pairs ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 24) and mixed pairs ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 12 autistic; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 12 non-autistic). Each participant completed three semi-structured interactions with their partner, rating rapport after each interaction. Non-autistic pairs experienced higher self-rated rapport than mixed and autistic pairs, and autistic pairs experienced higher rapport than mixed pairs. In Study 2 ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 80) autistic and non-autistic observers rated interactional rapport while watching videoed interactions between autistic pairs, non-autistic pairs, and mixed pairs ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 18, a subset of participants in Study 1). Mixed pairs were rated significantly lower on rapport than autistic and non-autistic pairs, and autistic pairs were rated more highly for rapport than non-autistic pairs. Both autistic and non-autistic observers show similar patterns in how they rate the rapport of autistic, non-autistic, and mixed pairs. In summary, autistic people experience high interactional rapport when interacting with other autistic people, and this is also detected by external observers. Rather than autistic people experiencing low rapport in all contexts, their rapport ratings are influenced by a mismatch of diagnosis. These findings suggest that autistic people possess a distinct mode of social interaction style, rather than demonstrating social skills deficits. These data are considered in terms of their implications for psychological theories of autism, as well as practical impact on educational and clinical practice.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We propose to decompose reciprocal social interactions in their basic computational constituents. Specifically, we test the assumption that autistic individuals disregard information regarding the stakes of social interactions when adapting to others. We compared 24 adult autistic participants to 24 neurotypical ({NT}) participants engaging in a repeated dyadic competitive game against artificial agents with calibrated reciprocal adaptation capabilities. Critically, participants were framed to believe either that they were competing against somebody else or that they were playing a gambling game. Only the {NT} participants did alter their adaptation strategy when they held information regarding others' competitive incentives, in which case they outperformed the {AS} group. Computational analyses of trial-by-trial choice sequences show that the behavioural repertoire of autistic people exhibits subnormal flexibility and mentalizing sophistication, especially when information regarding opponents’ incentives was available. These two computational phenotypes yield 79\% diagnosis classification accuracy and explain 62\% of the severity of social symptoms in autistic participants. Such computational decomposition of the autistic social phenotype may prove relevant for drawing novel diagnostic boundaries and guiding individualized clinical interventions in autism.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is characterized by challenges in social communication and the presence of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. Notably, males are four times as likely as females to be diagnosed with autism. Despite efforts to increase representation and characterization of autistic females, research studies consistently enroll small samples of females, or exclude females altogether. Importantly, researchers often rely on standardized measures to confirm diagnosis prior to enrollment in research studies. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of one such measure (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, {ADOS}) on research inclusion/exclusion rates by sex in autistic adults, all of whom had a preexisting community diagnosis of autism (n = 145, 95 male, 50 female). Using the {ADOS} as a confirmatory diagnostic measure resulted in the exclusion of autistic females at a rate over 2.5 times higher than that of autistic males. We compared sex ratios in our sample to those in other large, publically available datasets that rely either on community diagnosis (6 datasets, total n = 42,209) or standardized assessments (2 datasets, total n = 214) to determine eligibility of participants for research. Reliance on community diagnosis rather than confirmatory diagnostic assessments resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios. These results provide evidence for a “leaky” recruitment-to-research pipeline for females in autism research. Lay Summary Despite efforts to increase the representation of autistic females in research, studies consistently enroll small samples of females or exclude females altogether. We find that despite making up almost 50\% of the initially recruited sample based upon self-report of community diagnosis, autistic females are disproportonately excluded from research participation as a result of commonly used autism diagnostic measures. In our sample, and several other publically available datasets, reliance on community diagnosis resulted in significantly more equal sex ratios.},

This study explored the experience of the pathway to an autism diagnosis during adulthood for adults living in Australia.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative phenomenological study and interviewed 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to autism diagnosis in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed verbatim, and transcripts were analyzed by using a thematic approach.
Results: Data analysis resulted in 6 themes and 20 meaning units that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two interwoven journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic, whereas the clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports.
Conclusions: Given the potential benefits for adults obtaining a formal autism diagnosis and accessing post-diagnostic supports, it is important that health professionals and governments collaborate to reduce access barriers and ensure adequate services are available. The findings from this study informed the development of Australia's national guideline for autism diagnosis.
Community brief
Why is this an important issue?
The experience of being diagnosed as autistic as an adult is not well understood, particularly in Australia. Research from other places, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, suggests that receiving an autism diagnosis in adulthood is difficult and time-consuming, but brings relief. We do not know whether this is the same for adults in Australia.
What was the purpose of this study?
This study aimed at exploring the experience of seeking an autism diagnosis during adulthood in Australia.
What did the researchers do?
We conducted interviews with 13 adults who identified as autistic about their pathway to an autism diagnosis. Three sets of interview questions were used, depending on whether they had already obtained an autism diagnosis, were going through the assessment process, or were self-diagnosed. Adults completed the interview in their mode of choice. Spoken interviews were transcribed word-for-word, and the transcripts were analyzed to identify common themes.
What were the results of the study?
We identified six themes that described the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. These themes involved two related journeys that spanned before, during, and after the diagnostic process. The personal journey involved feeling different, considering autism, and living as autistic. The clinical journey involved missed opportunities, varied diagnostic experiences, and absent supports. Before starting the diagnostic process in adulthood, participants described always feeling different and many missed opportunities to receive an autism diagnosis in their younger years.
During the diagnostic process, participants described beginning to consider whether they were autistic and the varied pathways they underwent to confirm this. After the diagnostic process, participants described their experiences of living as autistic and a lack of post-diagnostic supports tailored to their needs.
What do these findings add to what was already known?
Our findings were similar to previous research findings from other countries, including the complex journey to diagnosis, relief and understanding on identifying as autistic, and lack of post-diagnostic services. However, to our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore the experiences of adults seeking an autism diagnosis in Australia. Further, we included participants who did not have a formal diagnosis of autism. This group of people is often excluded from autism research, and their experiences of seeking an autism diagnosis are largely unknown.
What are potential weaknesses in the study?
The weaknesses of our study included recruiting a relatively small sample of mostly Caucasian females, and we did not consult with our study participants or other autistic adults to see whether our final themes aligned well with their experience. However, no new findings emerged in later interviews and our findings were similar to international literature. Future research should recruit more diverse groups of autistic adults and involve greater levels of autistic input.
How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?
Our findings informed the development of the “National Guideline for the Assessment and Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Australia,” a first step toward improving autism diagnosis in Australia.},

Our aim was to identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by autistic adults compared with non-autistic adults and to link these barriers to self-reported adverse health consequences.
Design Following consultation with the autistic community at an autistic conference, Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered online through social media platforms.
Setting A 52-item, international, online survey.
Participants 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic adults.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported barriers to accessing healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes.
Results Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37\% of non-autistic respondents reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner ({GP}). The highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms warrant a {GP} visit (72\%), difficulty making appointments by telephone (62\%), not feeling understood (56\%), difficulty communicating with their doctor (53\%) and the waiting room environment (51\%). Autistic adults reported a preference for online or text-based appointment booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, the first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait. Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults were associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes included untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive treatment or surgery due to late presentations and untreated potentially life-threatening conditions. There were no significant differences in difficulty attending, barriers experienced or adverse outcomes between formally diagnosed and self-identified autistic respondents.
Conclusions Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication needs and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs are as necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is accompanied by highly individualized neuroanatomical deviations that potentially map onto distinct genotypes and clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to link differences in brain anatomy to specific biological pathways to pave the way toward targeted therapeutic interventions.

Methods:

The authors examined neurodevelopmental differences in cortical thickness and their genomic underpinnings in a large and clinically diverse sample of 360 individuals with {ASD} and 279 typically developing control subjects (ages 6–30 years) within the {EU}-{AIMS} Longitudinal European Autism Project ({LEAP}). The authors also examined neurodevelopmental differences and their potential pathophysiological mechanisms between clinical {ASD} subgroups that differed in the severity and pattern of sensory features.

Results:

In addition to significant between-group differences in “core” {ASD} brain regions (i.e., fronto-temporal and cingulate regions), individuals with {ASD} manifested as neuroanatomical outliers within the neurotypical cortical thickness range in a wider neural system, which was enriched for genes known to be implicated in {ASD} on the genetic and/or transcriptomic level. Within these regions, the individuals’ total (i.e., accumulated) degree of neuroanatomical atypicality was significantly correlated with higher polygenic scores for {ASD} and other psychiatric conditions, and it scaled with measures of symptom severity. Differences in cortical thickness deviations were also associated with distinct sensory subgroups, especially in brain regions expressing genes involved in excitatory rather than inhibitory neurotransmission.

Conclusions:

The study findings corroborate the link between macroscopic differences in brain anatomy and the molecular mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in {ASD}, and provide future targets for stratification and subtyping.},

          The steady rise in number of youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) has led to the need to examine transition of care considerations specific to {ASD}.

          Recent findings 
          Health-care transition is a delicate time when children with {ASD} outgrow the services of pediatric programs and enter a fragmented healthcare system that is unfamiliar, insufficiently knowledgeable, and underfunded for their needs.

Mismanagement of students’ transition into higher education institutions, coupled with a general lack of knowledge regarding their unique needs, can lead to anxiety, stigmatisation, bullying, and poor performance. The objective of this cross-sectional mixed-methods study was to explore the academic, social, institutional, and environmental challenges of students with {ASD}. Convenience sampling resulted in a sample of 74 students enrolled at a large, urban research university in the southeastern United States. Findings revealed significant differences between gender and use of support services, diagnosis disclosure, social engagement, and difficulties interacting with neurotypical people in an environment often perceived as ill-equipped to provide support. Consequently, potential institutional, programmatic, and policy implications emerged.},

	abstract = {Autistic children grow to become autistic adults, and autism is increasingly diagnosed in adulthood and later life. This qualitative study aimed to understand experiences of autism throughout adulthood. A national cohort study of autistic adults and relatives of autistic adults ({ASC}-{UK}), enabled purposive recruitment of a diverse sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 autistic adults (aged 20–71 years), mostly diagnosed in adulthood, and 16 relatives (aged 31–81 years) of autistic adults diagnosed across both childhood and adulthood (including some with learning disability). Interview topics included health, relationships, education, employment, quality of life and everyday experiences. Thematic analysis of the accounts of the autistic adults identified six key themes relating to their experiences: (1) diagnosis as validating yet limiting; (2) supportive and non-supportive social agents; (3) the “invisibility” of the needs of autistic adults; (4) health in the context of autism; (5) staying ‘outside’ the circle; and (6) multiple lives with autism. Data from relatives about autistic adult experiences gave additional perspectives on these themes. Experiences reported in other studies–of ‘difference’ from others, challenges of social engagement, and learning to ‘conform’ to society’s expectations–were evident and relevant to male and female autistic adults, across all age groups, and unrelated to stage of life when diagnosed. Some expressed disappointment with their lives, but others were proud of their achievements. Education and employment, whilst challenging for many, were also rewarding for some. Health care and social services were often experienced as inaccessible, inappropriate, or lacking understanding of the individual’s needs. We conclude that greater public understanding of autism as experienced in adulthood is needed. Key priorities are improving the availability of ‘appropriate’ health and social care services for autistic adults and families, and providing practical support to enable enhanced participation in life.},

	abstract = {Introduction Autism spectrum conditions ({ASC}) develop early in life and are thought to last a lifetime. However, {ASC} research has two major knowledge gaps that hinder progression in understanding the concept of {ASC} and in providing proper support for autistic adults: (1) the majority of knowledge about {ASC} mainly stems from childhood studies so little is known about older autistic adults and (2) while it is broadly recognised that {ASC} is a heterogeneous condition, we do not yet understand the differences in trajectories leading to their future outcome. We aim to fill both knowledge gaps.
Methods and analysis A multistage overlapping cohort design assessing (cognitive) ageing in {ASC} is designed to obtain an accelerated longitudinal data set. Data, including a multitude of questionnaires, diagnostics and cognitive tests, are collected over four waves within a 10-year time frame. This will provide information regarding actual changes in quality of life, co-occurring health conditions and cognition as well as the possibility to test external validity and temporal stability in newly formed behavioural subtypes. Participants consist of three groups of adults aged 20–90 years: (1) with a clinical diagnosis of {ASC}, (2) with a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}) but no {ASC}, (3) no {ASC}/{ADHD} (ie, comparison group). The sample size differs between waves and instruments. Detailed analysis plans will be preregistered in {AsPredicted} or at the Open Science Framework.
Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review board of the Department of Psychology of the University of Amsterdam (wave 1 2011-{PN}-1952 and 2013-{PN}-2668, wave 2 2015-{BC}-4270, waves 3 and 4 2018-{BC}-9285).

Common genetic variants contribute substantially to {ASD} susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with {ASD}. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with {ASD} and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging {GWAS} results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across {ASD} subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that {GWAS} performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in {ASD}.},

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare the continuity of care of autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the Center for Autism Services and Transition ({CAST}), to propensity score matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. The unadjusted median Bice–Boxerman continuity of care index was 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for {CAST} patients, 0.5 (interquartile range = 0.3–1.0) for Medicare beneficiaries, and 0.6 (interquartile range = 0.4–1.0) for privately insured autistic adults. In multivariable models controlling for demographic characteristics, on average, {CAST} patients had continuity of care indices that were 10\% higher than national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries (p {\textless} 0.0001). Continuity of care among {CAST} patients did not significantly differ from that of the national sample of privately insured autistic adults (p = 0.08). Our findings suggest that medical homes, like {CAST}, may be a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults. Lay abstract There is a nationally recognized need for innovative healthcare delivery models to improve care continuity for autistic adults as they age out of pediatric and into adult healthcare systems. One possible model of care delivery is called the “medical home”. The medical home is not a residential home, but a system where a patient’s healthcare is coordinated through a primary care physician to ensure necessary care is received when and where the patient needs it. We compared the continuity of care among autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the {CAST}, to matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. Continuity of primary care among {CAST} patients was significantly better than that of matched national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries and similar to that of privately insured autistic adults. Our findings suggest that medical homes, like {CAST}, are a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults.},

	abstract = {The concept of autism is a significant contribution from child psychiatry that has entered wider culture and public consciousness, and has evolved significantly over the last four decades. Taking a rather personal retrospective, reflecting on our own time in autism research, this review explores changes in the concept of autism and the implications of these for future research. We focus on seven major changes in how autism is thought of, operationalised, and recognised: (1) from a narrow definition to wide diagnostic criteria; (2) from a rare to a relatively common condition, although probably still under‐recognised in women; (3) from something affecting children, to a lifelong condition; (4) from something discreet and distinct, to a dimensional view; (5) from one thing to many ‘autisms’, and a compound or ‘fractionable’ condition; (6) from a focus on ‘pure’ autism, to recognition that complexity and comorbidity is the norm; and finally, (7) from conceptualising autism purely as a ‘developmental disorder’, to recognising a neurodiversity perspective, operationalised in participatory research models. We conclude with some challenges for the field and suggestions for areas currently neglected in autism research.

This review summarizes recent developments in human genetics research in autism, complemented by epigenetic and transcriptomic findings. The clinical heterogeneity of autism is mirrored by a complex genetic architecture involving several types of common and rare variants, ranging from point mutations to large copy number variants, and either inherited or spontaneous (de novo). More than 100 risk genes have been implicated by rare, often de novo, potentially damaging mutations in highly constrained genes. These account for substantial individual risk but a small proportion of the population risk. In contrast, most of the genetic risk is attributable to common inherited variants acting en masse, each individually with small effects. Studies have identified a handful of robustly associated common variants. Different risk genes converge on the same mechanisms, such as gene regulation and synaptic connectivity. These mechanisms are also implicated by genes that are epigenetically and transcriptionally dysregulated in autism. Major challenges to understanding the biological mechanisms include substantial phenotypic heterogeneity, large locus heterogeneity, variable penetrance, and widespread pleiotropy. Considerable increases in sample sizes are needed to better understand the hundreds or thousands of common and rare genetic variants involved. Future research should integrate common and rare variant research, multi-omics data including genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics, and refined phenotype assessment with multidimensional and longitudinal measures.},

The present study examines medical and psychiatric conditions endorsed by autistic adults and documents differences between those diagnosed with {ASD} in childhood versus adulthood, as well as across age groups and sex at birth. 4657 legally independent adults (ages 18–85, M = 33.4 years) with professional {ASD} diagnoses who completed a medical questionnaire were drawn from the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge ({SPARK}) study. Chi square analyses, t-tests, and logistic regressions were used to compare medical and psychiatric conditions between age groups, sex at birth and adults diagnosed in childhood (before age 21) versus adulthood (at or after 21 years). Overall number of conditions endorsed as being diagnosed by a professional was high, with an average of 1.69 ({SD} = 2.01) medical or developmental and 2.98 ({SD} = 2.29) psychiatric conditions reported across the sample. Females were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions ({OR} = 1.68). Adult-diagnosed adults were more likely to endorse psychiatric conditions ({OR} = 2.71) and reported more lifetime psychiatric diagnoses (M = 3.15, {SD} = 2.23) than their childhood-diagnosed counterparts (M = 2.81, {SD} = 2.33). These findings underscore the need for research to better understand and treat co-occurring psychiatric conditions in autistic adults and report and consider the age of diagnosis in adult autism samples. Moreover, results suggest it is imperative that mental health professionals receive autism training to promote accurate differential diagnosis and equitable access to mental health care for autistic adults with co-occurring psychiatric conditions.},

Using multi-level models, potential discontinuity of service patterns at the point of high school exit were examined, as well as the rate of change in services received and needed during the high school years and into the post-high school period. Differences between those with and without {ID} were probed. Study findings indicated that overall, sample members experienced a reduction in receipt of services during high school, particularly for those without co-occurring {ID}. After high school exit, sample members experienced a decline in services received; for those without {ID}, there was a continuous rate of loss of services after leaving high school but for those with {ID}, there was a sharp decline in services received. Unmet service needs increased right after high school exit for both those with and without {ID}. These patterns reflect loss of entitlement for services that accompanies high school exit, and the limited availability of adult services for individuals with {ASD}. This study documented not only the post-high school service cliff that has been the subject of much concern, but also that the loss of services begins long before high school exit and that sub-groups of the population with {ASD} are particularly vulnerable., In this research we studied changes in the number of services received before and after high school exit in a large sample of individuals with {ASD}. With each passing year during high school, individuals with {ASD} received fewer services. At the time of high school exit, there was a sharp drop in the number of services received, particularly for those with co-occurring intellectual disability.

In this paper, we argue that all autism intervention stakeholders need to understand and actively engage with the views of autistic people and with neurodiversity as a concept and movement. In so doing, intervention researchers and practitioners are required to move away from a normative agenda and pay diligence to environmental goodness-of-fit, autistic developmental trajectories, internal drivers and experiences, and autistic prioritized intervention targets. Autism intervention researchers must respond to these debates by reframing effectiveness, developing tools to measure autistic prioritized outcomes, and forming partnerships with autistic people. There is a pressing need for increased reflection and articulation around how intervention practices align with a neurodiversity framework and greater emphasis within intervention programmes on natural developmental processes, coping strategies, autonomy, and well-being.},

	abstract = {The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}-5) controversially combined previously distinct subcategories of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) into a single diagnostic category. However, genetic convergences and divergences between different {ASD} subcategories are unclear. By retrieving 1725 exonic de novo mutations ({DNMs}) from 1628 subjects with autistic disorder ({AD}), 1873 from 1564 subjects with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ({PDD}-{NOS}), 276 from 247 subjects with Asperger’s syndrome ({AS}), and 2077 from 2299 controls, we found that rates of putative functional {DNMs} (loss-of-function, predicted deleterious missense, and frameshift) in all three subcategories were significantly higher than those in control. We then investigated the convergences and divergences of the three {ASD} subcategories based on four genetic aspects: whether any two {ASD} subcategories (1) shared significantly more genes with functional {DNMs}, (2) exhibited similar spatio-temporal expression patterns, (3) shared significantly more candidate genes, and (4) shared some {ASD}-associated functional pathways. It is revealed that {AD} and {PDD}-{NOS} were broadly convergent in terms of all four genetic aspects, suggesting these two {ASD} subcategories may be genetically combined. {AS} was divergent to {AD} and {PDD}-{NOS} for aspects of functional {DNMs} and expression patterns, whereas {AS} and {AD}/{PDD}-{NOS} were convergent for aspects of candidate genes and functional pathways. Our results indicated that the three {ASD} subcategories present more genetic convergences than divergences, favouring {DSM}-5’s new classification. This study suggests that specifically defined genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes should be integrated analyzed for precise diagnosis of complex disorders, such as {ASD}.},

The most-reported barriers to accessing treatment are therapists’ lack of knowledge and expertise surrounding autism, as well as unwillingness to treat autistic individuals. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group and examined 498 adult-patient psychotherapists on knowledge about autism and self-perceived competency to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability compared to patients with other diagnoses. Psychotherapists rated their education about autism in formal training, and competency in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with autism, lowest compared to patients with all other diagnoses surveyed in the study, including those with comparable prevalence rates. Many therapists had misconceptions and outdated beliefs about autism. Few had completed additional training on autism, but the majority were interested in receiving it. Greater knowledge about autism was positively linked to openness to accept autistic patients. The results point to an alarming gap in knowledge necessary for adequate mental health care for individuals with autism.
Lay abstract
Most autistic adults experience mental health problems. There is a great demand for psychotherapeutic support that addresses the specific needs of autistic individuals. However, people with autism encounter difficulties trying to access diagnostic and therapeutic services. This study was conducted by a participatory autism research group: a group in which autistic individuals and scientists collaborate. The group developed a questionnaire for psychotherapists in Germany to assess their knowledge about autism. Psychotherapists also rated their ability to diagnose and treat autistic patients without intellectual disability, and patients with other psychological diagnoses. Many of the 498 psychotherapists that responded reported little knowledge and outdated beliefs about autism, as well as little training on treating patients with autism. Their expertise about other psychological conditions was more comprehensive. However, many psychotherapists were interested in professional training on autism. Those with more knowledge were also more open to treating autistic patients. In conclusion, psychotherapists’ lack of knowledge and expertise seem to be a major barrier for adults with autism to receiving helpful psychotherapeutic support. The results demonstrate the need for an advancement in autism education during psychotherapists’ training and in continuous education.},

	abstract = {Background
Having a mental health condition is related to significantly lower subjective Quality of Life ({QoL}) for people on the autism spectrum. Many autistic people do not participate in so-called ‘normative’ outcomes, i.e. the achievement of lifecourse goals judged to be important by adults in the general population (e.g. being employed). This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the presence of mental health conditions, subjective {QoL} and participation in normative outcomes in older autistic people.
Methods
69 autistic people (n = 48 males) aged 55 years and over were identified from two studies that are part of the {UK} Autism Spectrum Adulthood and Ageing research programme. Participants provided demographic data to establish normative outcome participation, and completed the World Health Organisation ({WHO}) {QoL} measure ({WHOQoL}-{BREF}) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale ({HADS}). Illustrative quotes focusing on normative outcomes were available from in-depth interviews (n = 8).
Results
{QoL} scores across all domains were lower for individuals who met indicative clinical cut-offs for depression (F(8,126) = 6.171, p {\textless} 0.001); findings were similar for anxiety (F(8,126) = 3.902, p {\textless} 0.001). Subjective {QoL} did not differ according to participation in normative outcomes (F(12,124.64) = 1.363, p = 0.192). The illustrative quotes suggested that aspects of daily life were related to {QoL} (i.e. friendships).
Conclusions
For older autistic people, the presence and severity of a likely mental health condition (i.e anxiety and depression) were associated with poorer {QoL}. However, participation in general population lifecourse goals may not well represent {QoL} of older autistic people, suggesting that service supports should be individually responsive.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum condition is associated with co-occurring physical health conditions and premature mortality. Autistic people experience multiple barriers to accessing healthcare. This study investigated autistic people’s experiences of healthcare and professionals’ experiences of providing healthcare to autistic people. Focus groups with 11 autistic people and one supporter, and 15 one-to-one interviews with healthcare professionals were completed. Nine themes emerged from the autistic participants’ data and eight themes emerged from the health professionals’ data. Three themes were identified by both groups: healthcare contacts (for improving the patient–provider relationship), making reasonable adjustments to healthcare (e.g. providing alternative places to wait for an appointment) and autism diagnosis. Autistic participants discussed the role of cognitive factors in the success of healthcare visits (such as rehearsing an anticipated conversation with the clinician the night before an appointment) and clinicians described system-level constraints that may affect healthcare delivery (such as time limits on appointments). This study identified inexpensive changes that health professionals and managers can make to improve healthcare access for autistic people.
Lay abstract
Research has shown that on average, autistic people are more likely to die earlier than non-autistic people, and barriers can stop autistic people accessing healthcare. We carried out a study where we interviewed healthcare professionals (including doctors and nurses), and held discussion groups of autistic people. Our results highlighted several key points: seeing the same professional is important for autistic people and clinicians; both clinicians and autistic people think making adjustments to healthcare is important (and often possible); autistic people process information in a different way and so may need extra support in appointments; and that clinicians are often constrained by time pressures or targets.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence indicates that the defining characteristics of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) are distributed throughout the general population; hence, understanding the correlates of aging in people with high autistic traits could shed light on {ASD} and aging. 915 members of the Dunedin longitudinal birth cohort completed a measure of autistic traits at age 45. A composite measure of the “pace of aging” was derived by tracking the decline in 19 biomarkers across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years. Facial age was also assessed. Reports of perceived health were collected from participants themselves, informants, and interviewers. Higher self-reported autistic traits significantly correlated with a faster pace of aging, older facial age, and poorer self-, informant-, and interviewer-rated health. After control for sex, {SES} and {IQ}, autistic traits were significantly associated with each variable: pace of aging (β = 0.09), facial age (β = 0.08), self- (β = −0.15), informant (β = −0.12), and interviewer-rated (β = −0.17) health. Autistic traits measured at age 45 are associated with faster aging. Participants with high autistic traits appear to be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, as previously reported for those clinically diagnosed with {ASD}. Therefore, autistic traits may have important health implications. Replicating these findings in samples of autistic people is needed to identify the mechanism of their effect on aging and physical health to improve outcomes for those with {ASD} diagnoses or high autistic traits. Lay Summary The role that autistic traits have in relation to health outcomes has not been investigated. We looked at how physical health and aging (measured with self-reported questions and decline in multiple biological measures) were related to autistic traits (measured with a questionnaire, at age 45). We found that higher autistic traits were associated with poorer reports of physical health, and a faster pace of aging. This suggests that both those with autism and those with higher autistic traits may be more likely to experience poorer health outcomes.},

	shorttitle = {Older Age Autism Research},
	abstract = {Background: There is a paucity of research involving older autistic people, as highlighted in a number of systematic reviews. However, it is less clear whether this is changing, and what the trends might be in research on autism in later life. Methods: We conducted a broad review of the literature by examining the number of results from a search in three databases ({PubMed}, Embase, {PsycINFO}) across four age groups: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We also examined the abstracts of all the included articles for the older age group and categorized them under broad themes. Results: Our database search identified 145 unique articles on autism in older age, with an additional 67 found by the authors (hence, the total number of articles in this review is 212). Since 2012, we found a 392\% increase in research with older autistic people, versus 196\% increase for childhood/early life, 253\% for adolescence, and 264\% for adult research. We identify 2012 as a point at which, year-on-year, older age autism research started increasing, with the most commonly researched areas being cognition, the brain, and genetics. However, older adult research only accounted for 0.4\% of published autism studies over the past decade. Conclusions: This increase reflects a positive change in the research landscape, although research with children continues to dominate. We also note the difficulty of identifying papers relevant to older age autism research, and propose that a new keyword could be created to increase the visibility and accessibility of research in this steadily growing area. Community brief Why is this topic important? Autistic children grow into autistic adults, and autistic adults grow old. However, there is very little research about older autistic people. This is important so we know how to support older autistic people. What is the purpose of this article? We wanted to examine how autism research activity has changed over time with respect to four life stages: infancy, childhood and adolescence, adulthood, and older age. We then more closely looked at older age autism research to point out important gaps where more research is needed. What did the authors do? We conducted a broad review of the literature on autism and described what life stages are studied in published research. We looked at how the amount of research on different life stages has changed over time. We further examined studies focused on older age and summarized the topics covered. What did you find about this topic? Our review estimates that only 0.4\% of autism-related publications over the past decade are about older autistic people. We identify 2012 as a turning point since when the number of studies has markedly increased year-on-year. Encouragingly, the percentage increase in autism research over the past decade is greater for older age research (392\% rise) than childhood/early life (196\%), adolescence (253\%), or adulthood research (264\%). What do the authors recommend? We suggest that there are many research areas that need addressing. Specifically, more research is needed on social isolation and the practicalities of living arrangements for older autistic people, as well as more studies including older autistic adults with intellectual disability. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? We do not think that our findings will immediately benefit the lives of autistic people. However, we do hope to draw attention to topics where research is needed to improve the lives of autistic older people. We also suggest that a new keyword could be created that researchers could then include in their articles to help autistic people and those interested in autism and aging find relevant writings.},

To examine this structural discrimination, we systematically searched funded research on all physical health-disparity conditions in autistic adults using {NIH} {RePORTER}.

Autism status was determined based on registration for disability accommodations based on autism and/or self-reports of an autism diagnosis. Health outcomes included self-rated physical health, self-rated mental health, depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. Students with autism reported poorer self-rated physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety than other students, even in the presence of controls for other disabilities. Students with autism also reported a lower likelihood of sleep deprivation and binge drinking than other students. Our results extend previous research on the health correlates of autism by considering additional indicators of health and by incorporating a direct comparison to neurotypical students. They encourage consideration of how health services for students with autism can be improved, especially for mental health problems, and argue for integrated support services that address the full constellation of physical and mental health challenges that students on the spectrum experience.
Lay abstract
Studies have shown that children and older adults on the autism spectrum experience more physical and mental health problems than their neurotypical peers. Less is known about the physical and mental health of college students on the spectrum. Studying college students is important because young adults on the spectrum are enrolling in college at increasing rates and because health problems can be a barrier to succeeding in college. We collected data from 2820 students at 14 colleges and universities using an online survey, some of whom had registered for accommodations based on autism and others of whom had not. We used the data to compare the physical and mental health of students on the spectrum to their neurotypical peers. Because students with autism often report other disabilities that also affect health, we accounted for whether they experienced a learning disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory impairment, mobility impairment, mental health disorder, or any other disabilities. We assessed health using self-reports of how healthy they were physically and mentally, and reports of depressive symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, sleep deprivation, and binge drinking. We found that students with autism reported poorer physical and mental health, more depressive symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety even after taking into account other disabilities they may have experienced. They were also less likely to report sleep deprivation and binge drinking. Our results argue for developing specialized services to address the physical and mental health challenges of college students on the spectrum.},

Our academic–community partnership used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 39 autistic adults and 16 people who had experience supporting autistic adults in healthcare settings. Participants identified patient-level, autism-related factors that impact healthcare interactions, including verbal communication skills, sensory sensitivities, challenges with body awareness, slow processing speed, atypical non-verbal communication, and challenges with organization. However, the success of healthcare interactions largely depended on the interplay between patient- and provider-level factors, as well as the larger context in which patients were receiving care. Provider-level factors included providers’ knowledge about autism in adults, incorrect assumptions about individual patients, willingness to allow written communication, use of accessible language, openness to providing other accommodations, and skill in appropriately incorporating supporters. System-level factors included the availability of supporters, complexity of the healthcare system, accessibility of healthcare facilities, and stigma about autism. Further efforts are needed to empower patients, adequately train providers, increase the accessibility of the healthcare system, and decrease discrimination.},

	abstract = {Research studying aging in adults with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is growing, but longitudinal work is needed. Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, altered hippocampal volumes and fornix integrity, and verbal memory difficulties compared with neurotypical ({NT}) adults. This study examined longitudinal aging in middle-age adults with {ASD} versus a matched {NT} group, and compared findings with cross-sectional age effects across a broad adult age range. Participants were 194 adults with (n = 106; 74 male) and without (n = 88; 52 male) {ASD}, ages 18–71. Participants (n = 45; 40–70 age range) with two visits (2–3 years apart) were included in a longitudinal analysis. Hippocampal volume, fornix fractional anisotropy ({FA}), and verbal memory were measured via T1-weighted {MRI}, diffusion tensor imaging, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, respectively. Longitudinal mixed models were used for hippocampal system variables and reliable change index categories were used for Auditory Verbal Learning Test analyses. Multivariate regression was used for cross-sectional analyses. Middle-age adults with {ASD} had greater longitudinal hippocampal volume loss and were more likely to show clinically meaningful decline in short-term memory, compared with {NT}. In contrast, cross-sectional associations between increasing age and worsening short-term memory were identified in {NT}, but not autistic adults. Reduced fornix {FA} and long-term memory in {ASD} were found across the broad cross-sectional age range. These preliminary longitudinal findings suggest accelerated hippocampal volume loss in {ASD} and slightly higher rates of clinically-meaningful decline in verbal short-term memory. Contradictory cross-sectional and longitudinal results underscore the importance of longitudinal aging research in autistic adults. Lay Summary Autistic adults have increased risk of dementia, differences in brain memory structures, and difficulty with memory compared with neurotypical ({NT}) adults. However, there are no publications that follow the same middle-age autistic adults over time to see how their brain and memory change. Our preliminary findings in a small middle-age autism sample suggest a key memory brain structure, the hippocampus, may shrink faster over 2–3 years compared with {NT}, and short-term memory may become more challenging for some. Across a broad adult range, autistic adults also had reduced integrity of connections to the hippocampus and greater challenges with long-term memory. In our larger sample across a broad age range, the results did not hint at this aforementioned pattern of accelerated aging. This underscores the importance of more aging research in autism, and especially research where people are followed over time.},

There is also high incidence of intellectual disability among the autistic individuals. However, the prevalence is increasing which may be due to changes in diagnostic procedures, practice and standards, or due to increase in incidence or may be due to diagnostic over substitution. Aim: To study prevalence of autism in patient who reported for disability. Materials \& Methods: The present study is a retrospective study which was conducted over a period of 2 and half year from July 2017 to December 2019 among all the patients who reported for disability in the Government Psychiatric Diseases Hospital Jammu. After getting clearance from the institutional ethical committee the records of all these patients seen during this period were reviewed and the diagnosis of all these patients was confirmed according to {ICD} 10.
Results: The prevalence of autism in patients who reported for disability was 64.5\%. 76.1\% autistic patients were males whereas 23.9\% were females. 69\% autistic patients were below 6 years of age followed by 26.8\% who were in the age group of 7 to 12 years and only 4.2\% patients were between 13 to 18 years of age.
Conclusion: From present study we conclude that there is high prevalence of autism among the patients who reported for disability. Hence appropriate measures should be taken up by the concerned authorities for the early identification},

In the past decade, hundreds of genes have been identified that contribute to the serious deficits in communication, social cognition, and behavior that patients often experience. However, these only account for 10-20\% of {ASD} cases, and patients with similar pathogenic variants may be diagnosed on very different levels of the spectrum. In this review, we will describe the genetic landscape of {ASD} and discuss how genetic modifiers such as copy number variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations likely play a key role in modulating the phenotypic spectrum of {ASD} patients. We also consider how genetic modifiers can alter convergent signaling pathways and lead to impaired neural circuitry formation. Lastly, we review sex-linked modifiers and clinical implications. Further understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for both comprehending {ASD} and for developing novel therapies.},

However, this has been little studied taking a dimensional approach to autistic traits and in older age.A total of 20,220 adults aged 50–81 years from the {PROTECT} study reported whether they experienced persistent sociocommunicative traits characteristic of autism. Approximately 1\%, 276 individuals, were identified as endorsing elevated autistic traits in childhood and currently, henceforth the “Autism Spectrum Trait” ({AST}) group. An age- and gender-matched comparison group was formed of 10,495 individuals who did not endorse any autistic behavioral traits, henceforth the “Control Older Adults” ({COA}) group. Differences between {AST} and {COA} groups were explored in self-reported psychiatric diagnoses, self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety, and self-reported physical health diagnoses. Associations were also examined between autistic traits and health across the whole sample.The {AST} group reported significantly elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses compared to the {COA} group. Additionally, the {AST} group showed significantly higher self-reported symptoms of current depression and anxiety than the {COA} group. However, few differences were observed in individual physical health conditions, and no differences in total co-occurring physical diagnoses between groups. Similar associations between autistic traits and health were also found taking a dimensional approach across the whole sample.These findings suggest that older adults with elevated autistic traits may be at greater risk of poorer mental, but not physical, health in later life. Future studies should incorporate polygenic scores to elucidate the possible genetic links between the propensity to autism/high autistic traits and to psychiatric conditions, and to explore whether those with elevated autistic traits experience particular barriers to mental health care.},

	abstract = {Background
Little is known about the impact of aging with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) on cognition. As a first step in addressing this gap in our knowledge, the current study examined cognitive functioning among older adults with elevated, but subclinical levels of autistic traits (i.e., the Broad Autism Phenotype; {BAP}) compared to older adults without the {BAP}.
Method
Forty older adults (aged 60–91, M = 73 years) were recruited and classified as meeting criteria for the {BAP} (n = 20) or not (control older adults, {COA}; n = 20). Different components of executive function as well as episodic memory were measured using standardized performance-based neuropsychological assessments in addition to a self-report questionnaire of executive function difficulties.
Results
Despite no differences in age, sex ratio, educational history or {IQ}, the {BAP} group demonstrated poorer performance on measures of executive function and episodic memory compared to the {COA} group. The {BAP} group also self-reported more executive function difficulties in everyday settings. Moreover, differences in working memory and attentional shifting were maintained after accounting for the influences of {IQ} and both depression and anxiety symptoms.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that aging with the {BAP} confers additional risk to cognitive function for older adults. As the {BAP} forms a bridge in the continuum from typical to atypical levels of autistic traits, these findings suggest that individuals with {ASD} might also incur cognitive costs as they age into older adulthood.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong evidence for genetic susceptibility. However, the effect sizes for implicated chromosomal loci are small, hard to replicate and current evidence does not explain the majority of the estimated heritability. Phenotypic heterogeneity could be one phenomenon complicating identification of genetic factors. We used data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, head circumferences, and ages at exams as classifying variables to identify more clinically similar subgroups of individuals with {ASD}. We identified two distinct subgroups of cases within the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange dataset, primarily defined by the overall severity of evaluated traits. In addition, there was significant familial clustering within subgroups (odds ratio, {OR} ≈ 1.38–1.42, P {\textless} 0.00001), and genotypes were more similar within subgroups compared to the unsubgrouped dataset (Fst = 0.17 ± 0.0.0009). These results suggest that the subgroups recapitulate genetic etiology. Using the same approach in an independent dataset from the Autism Genome Project, we similarly identified two distinct subgroups of cases and confirmed this severity-based dichotomy. We also observed evidence for genetic contributions to subgroups identified in the replication dataset. Our results provide more effective methods of phenotype definition that should increase power to detect genetic factors influencing risk for {ASD}.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Intellectual disability ({ID}) is one of the strongest predictors of outcomes for those with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). Behavioral problems that are commonly observed in autism may be related to the core features of {ASD} or comorbid diagnoses. Aims: To assess the prevalence of {ASD} in those with {ID} referred for disability assessment and the associated medical and psychological comorbid issues. Materials and methods: The present study was a cross-sectional study that included 133 children with mild or moderate {ID} between 6 and 18 years of age. The study tools used were Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism ({ISAA}), Behavior Problems Inventory ({BPI}), and a questionnaire to assess medical symptoms.
Results: The prevalence of comorbid {ASD} in children with {ID} was 16.39\%. Individuals with {ASD} had higher behavioral problems (p = 0.001) and medical issues that included gastrointestinal ({GI}) symptoms (constipation, p = 0.001; bloating, p = 0.03; and abdominal pain, p = 0.03) and seizure (p = 0.002). Children with severe {ASD} scores had higher behavioral problem scores.
Conclusion: Individuals with {ID} who were referred for disability assessment had a significant prevalence of {ASD}. These children had higher behavioral problems and medical issues. It is thus important to screen for {ASD} in individuals with {ID} for better management of these individuals.},

Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized. Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing Kanner\&apos;s original paper and subsequent changes. We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association\&apos;s diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.},

emotional impact of worries in neurotypical and autistic young people during
transition. Twenty-two autistic people and 22 neurotypical people, aged 16–18,
were recruited from mainstream schools. Participants completed a novel task to
identify and explore the nature of their main worries. The participants’ worry
frequency and distress levels in relation to their most salient concerns, and
their anxiety levels, were measured. Content analysis highlighted similarities
and differences between the two groups’ worries. Both groups worried about
failure and their prospects of further education. Autistic people were more
concerned about change and friendship, whereas more salient worries for
neurotypical individuals were about work and money. Autistic people were more
distressed by their worries than neurotypical individuals. Findings regarding
the nature of autistic young people’s worries may help inform interventions.
Moreover, asking autistic people about their worries as they leave school may
help to address their concerns, ease their transition and reduce distress.},

	shorttitle = {Global prevalence of autism},
	abstract = {Prevalence estimates of autism are essential for informing public policy, raising awareness, and developing research priorities. Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male-to-female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co-occurring intellectual disability was 33.0\%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case-finding methods in diverse world regions over time. Lay Summary We reviewed studies of the prevalence of autism worldwide, considering the impact of geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates. Approximately 1/100 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the world. Prevalence estimates increased over time and varied greatly within and across sociodemographic groups. These findings reflect changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.},
